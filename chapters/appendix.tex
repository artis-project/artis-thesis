\chapter{Contents of the Repositories}
The system is composed of four repositories that are managed in a GitHub organisation. The organisation as well as the repositories can be found at:
\begin{center}
    \texttt{\href{https://github.com/orgs/artis-project/repositories}{https://github.com/orgs/artis-project/repositories}}
\end{center}

The implementational details of each component and its associated repository are found in Chapter \ref{chap:implementation}, where each Section is named after the corresponding repository. Additonally, each repository contains a \texttt{README.md} file which contains important information on the component's installation and configuration.
