This chapter provides an overview of the existing literature on art tracking with IoT and blockchains, highlighting previous research, methods, and findings related to the research question. Lastly, we also provide an overview of this field's state of the art.

\section{IoT in Artwork Tracking and Monitoring}
When it comes to preserving artworks, several factors play a role. This includes their exposition to human factors as well as environmental variations \cite{woodenartworkmonitoring}. More specifically factors that can hamper artwork integrity include humidity, temperature, light, pollutants, and microbiological organisms \cite{riskassessment}. Usually, temperature and humidity are the most sensitive parameters \cite{riskassessment}. The monitoring of such factors can be of significant importance when it comes to artwork preservation and health \cite{environmentmonitoring}. 

In addition to the conservation of artworks in museums or galleries, there is also the aspect of ensuring the safety of artwork during transportation. 

There already exist systems to monitor the microclimate surrounding an artwork \cite{monitoringplatform}.
